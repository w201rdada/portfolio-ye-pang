## Pitfalls of a rules engine

Today, property and casualty insurance carriers are under increasing demands to reduce claim costs with anti-fraud initiatives across business lines (e.g., auto, property, liability, and worker's compensation). While smaller insurers mostly rely on claims adjusters to manually make referrals to special investigations unit (SIU) departments, larger insurers have turned to IT to develop rule-based systems that can assign fraud scores to claims and generate leads for SIU. These are usually fairly simple: add up all the weighted scores from a set of business rules to see if they are over a threshold. However, these systems are often inadequate. Further, there isa manual, imprecise, and expensive process to create/update the rules and their associative weights when fraud patterns change. With the help from data scientists, there are more automated and intelligent approaches to generating these leads to SIUs without overtaxing claims adjusters or having huge IT budgets.

## Data science driven

These fraud alert systems are often composed of thousands of individual rules. Because there are so many rules, it is next to impossible for a human to know what the “correct” weight is to use for each of the rules. Subjective manual adjustments made to tweak the overall score are usually biased and suboptimal. There are a couple ways data science can improve on the rule-based approach: 

1. If the problem is linearly solvable (i.e., fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims can be cleanly split from one another), a perceptron algorithm can be used to optimize the rule weights automatically to maximize a choice of statistical measures.

2. Regularization can also be applied during optimization to ensure that impactful rules receive more weights and trivial/outdated rules are found and corrected. 

In practice, fraud detection is likely a non-linear problem. Machine learning models like support vector machines and random forests combined with deep learning and natural language processing can better explore interactions among the rules.
One could also analyze text based claim notes to boost fraud detection. 

## Intelligent fraud detection    

Anti-fraud is generally a challenging area for data scientists. Not only do the predictions need to be accurate, they also have to be interpretable and actionable. While rules-based systems can break down a fraud score to triggered rules, it can be difficult to explain intuitively what a non-linear model does. Nonetheless, machine learning models often gain a non-trivial boost in prediction performance. More importantly, instead of second-guessing the scores coming out of a rule-based system, those energies can be rechanneled to focus on the handling of fraudulent claims such as evidence preparation. It makes sense to make the SIU referral process more adaptive and robust while taking some pressure off claims adjusters by removing the manual process of tweaking the rule-based systems.
